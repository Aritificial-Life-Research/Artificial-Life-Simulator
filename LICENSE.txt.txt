OPTION 1. GPL 3.0 (as defined in LICENSE.GPL.txt).

OPTION 2. Apache License Version 2.0 (as defined in LICENSE.APACHE.txt) with the following
additional condition placed under section 4:

e. You must either give recipients of the Work or Derivative Works access to the source
code (Source) of what you are distributing, according to the following provision from the OSD: 

"The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well
as compiled form. Where some form of a product is not distributed with source code, 
there must be a well-publicized means of obtaining the source code for no more than 
a reasonable reproduction cost, preferably downloading via the Internet without charge. 
The source code must be the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the 
program. Deliberately obfuscated source code is not allowed. Intermediate forms such 
as the output of a preprocessor or translator are not allowed."

or you must include a reference link to the source code of the Work in any software application
that derives from the Work. This link must be clearly visible to the user, and it must be visible
for at least 2 seconds unless the user clicks or presses a button to skip it. The reference must
include the following words: "This project derives from one or more projects with source code 
found at: ", followed by the reference link. The reference link must direct the user to a website
or document in which the source code is reasonably legible and easy to navagate through. A link 
to a Github repository is a good example of a reference link. If your Derived Work derives from 
multiple works that all fall under this Licence, you may combine those works into a single source 
code repository, and provide a reference link to that repository, given that the repository is 
organized by the different works.
